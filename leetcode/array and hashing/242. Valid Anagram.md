# 242. Valid Anagram
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

# Solution

## Approach 1: Sorting
By sorting the characters, the code transforms the problem into a comparison of the sorted strings, simplifying the anagram check.

However, it's worth noting that this approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the strings.

```py
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
```

## Approach 2: Hash Table
The time complexity of this solution is O(n)

```py
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        count = defaultdict(int)

        for i in s:
            count[i] += 1
        
        for i in t:
            count[i] -= 1

        for val in count.values():
            if val != 0:
                return False

        return True
```

## Approach 3: Hash Table (Using Array)
```bash
>>> ord('a')
97
>>> ord('z') - ord('a')
25
>>> ord('t') - ord('a')
19``
>>> [0]*5
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
Updating character count

```py
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        count = [0] * 26

        for i in s:
            count[ord(i) - ord('a')] += 1

        for i in t:
            count[ord(i) - ord('a')] -= 1

        for i in count:
            if i != 0:
                return False

        return True
```
